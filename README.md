# CS2 Dedicated Server Admin Control Panel

A cross-platform desktop control panel (Windows + Linux) for managing Counter-Strike 2 dedicated servers over RCON.

CS2 Control Panel is designed for server owners, match admins, and community operators who want a structured workflow for running server configs, switching maps, monitoring server health, and performing common admin actions from a single UI.

## Application Features

- **RCON connection management**
  - Connect/disconnect to a server with host, port, and password.
  - Send manual commands and execute saved server profiles.

- **Config Library**
  - Organize server configs by category.
  - Create, edit, duplicate, and delete configs.
  - Store multi-command profiles and run them with configurable execution behavior.

- **Map Library**
  - Maintain standard and workshop map profiles.
  - Tag and annotate map entries.
  - Assign map profiles directly to server configs.

- **Live Monitor**
  - Refresh status/stats on demand or at intervals.
  - View map, mode, player count, and raw server telemetry output.
  - Surface health indicators such as choke/loss/tick variance.

- **Import / Export**
  - Import/export all data or scoped data sets (configs/maps).
  - Share individual server config profiles.

- **RCON Ops+ utilities**
  - Preset command packs with rollback support.
  - Player actions (kick/ban/mute/swap team) with admin reason entry.
  - Scheduled automation hooks for recurring admin tasks.
  - Safety guardrails (dry-run mode, denylist/allowlist, destructive command confirmation).
  - Audit log export for administrative traceability.

## Tech Stack

- **.NET 8**
- **Avalonia UI (cross-platform desktop UI)**
- **CoreRCON** for RCON communication

## Project Structure

- `CS2AdminTool/` — Main Avalonia application
- `CS2AdminTool/Data/Seeds/` — Seed JSON files copied to app data on first run
- `build.ps1` — Windows build and packaging script
- `build-release.sh` — Linux/macOS build and packaging script
- `release-github.sh` — CLI helper to create a GitHub release with built artifacts
- `launch-linux.sh` — Launch helper that runs a published Linux binary (or falls back to dotnet source run)
- `dist/` — Generated build artifacts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows or Linux (Ubuntu, Arch, etc.)
- .NET SDK 8.0+
- Access to a CS2 server with RCON enabled

### Run from source

```powershell
# from repo root
dotnet build .\CS2AdminTool.sln

dotnet run --project .\CS2AdminTool\CS2AdminTool.csproj
```

### Build distributable packages

```bash
# from repo root (Linux/macOS)
./build-release.sh
```

```powershell
# from repo root (Windows PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build.ps1
```

This produces per-platform artifacts in `dist/` (linux-x64, linux-arm64, win-x64).

### Launch on Linux

If you built from source:

```bash
./build-release.sh
./launch-linux.sh linux-x64
```

If you downloaded a GitHub release artifact instead:

```bash
tar -xzf CS2AdminTool-linux-x64.tar.gz
cd <extracted-folder>
chmod +x CS2AdminTool
./CS2AdminTool
```

### Linux dotnet error troubleshooting

If you see an error like `dotnet: command not found`, you're likely trying to run source mode without the SDK installed.

- Preferred: use the **self-contained** release artifact and run `./CS2AdminTool` (no dotnet install needed).
- Alternative: install .NET 8 SDK/runtime and run with `dotnet run`.

## GitHub Release Automation

A release workflow is included at `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

- Push a tag like `v1.1.0`.
- GitHub Actions builds Linux/Windows self-contained binaries.
- The workflow publishes a GitHub Release and uploads the generated artifacts automatically.

## Data Storage

Application data is stored in the current user's local app data directory:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CS2AdminTool\Data`
- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/CS2AdminTool/Data` (or `~/.local/share/CS2AdminTool/Data` by default)

On first run, seed data is copied from `CS2AdminTool/Data/Seeds` if missing.

## Open Source Usage

This repository is intended for public/open-source usage.

If you use this project:

1. Keep your own server credentials secure.
2. Review and test command packs/configs before applying them to production servers.
3. Validate your local server rules and regional policies before using player-management actions.

## Security Notes

- RCON is powerful and potentially destructive if misused.
- Prefer running with dry-run and confirmation options while validating new workflows.
- Avoid committing private server endpoints/passwords to source control.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

- Open an issue to discuss bugs or feature ideas.
- Submit a PR with a clear description, rationale, and testing notes.
- Keep changes focused and avoid unrelated formatting churn.
